        The largest greenfield investment in Serbia ever
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, we have invested almost a billion euros in our network, opening
        Vip centers throughout Serbia and educating employees.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are part of the A1 Telekom Austria Group, which allows us to share
        experience, knowledge and expertise.

        We improve the market in the interest of users
      </p>
      <p>
        We were the first to enable complete freedom of communication by
        introducing UNLIMITED minutes and messages to all networks. There is no
        charge for number activation and call set-up in our network, and calls
        to customer service agents are free. We are the only ones who allow
        users to test the Vip network completely free of charge for a month via
        Come and try tariffs, without any obligations or costs.

        Gender equality and commitment to the family
      </p>
      <p>
        In our country, women and men are equally represented in all positions.
        The conditions for advancement, earnings and training are the same for
        everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are proud of the fact that we have provided employees, and especially
        parents, with a good balance between business and private life. That is
        why we were the first in Serbia to receive the Family Friendly
        Enterprise certificate.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as we believe that every mother should carelessly welcome her
        newborn, we pay future mothers in Vip the difference up to the agreed
        salary. All Vipovci for the third child receive a monthly compensation
        of 10,000 dinars until the child is 15 years old.
